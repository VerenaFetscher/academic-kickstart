I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Hamburg. 
I am also an Associate Member of Nuffield College (University of Oxford). 
My research is in comparative political economy. 
I study preference formation and political representations. 
Central questions I am interested in are why some people support higher levels of redistribution than others 
and what role institutional factors, identity and questions of fairness play as determinants for redistribution preferences. 
My current work further assesses the link between descriptive representation and 
substantive decision-making power in the German context. Methodologically, I combine quantitative observational analyses with experimental approaches. 


I am currently teaching seminars on topics in comparative political economy and on the 
politics of representation and economic inequality at the University of Hamburg. 
Previously, I have thought seminars in comparative political economy at the University of Mannheim.
