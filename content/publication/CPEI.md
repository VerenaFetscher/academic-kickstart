abstract = "Comparative political economy studies the interaction between politics and the market. It compares distributional outcomes across countries by assessing differences in the relationships among individuals, institutions and the economy. The key question is who gets what, when and how? This seminar introduces students to central topics in comparative political economy. Students will learn how political institutions shape economic outcomes, how power struggles between social actors influence political decisions, and how material and non-material concerns form individual preferences. The project seminar spans over two semesters. In the first half of the seminar (semester 1), students will learn how to systematically assess these and other questions in a way that prepares them to conduct their own research projects in the second half of the seminar (semester 2). Through reading, writing, and seminar participation, they will evaluate concepts, theoretical approaches, and empirical research that is most relevant to the field. In the second part (semester 2), students will work on their own research projects in the field of comparative political economy."
